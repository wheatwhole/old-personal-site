## actions and stuff ahh ui
everything has changed! although im buns at svelte, I somehow got it to work and this site rework marks the start of focaccia.dev

misc: 
- new logo visible in the navbar
- there is a secret in the title, see if you can find it



interface improvements:
- polished navbar
- revamped my about me page to be less cluttered
- bouncy animations everywhere
- and of course fast load times
- added a new project to my about me page which you can check out later. its made using fricking tailwindcss so don't expect a lot
